# TQSim

TQSim is an anyon-based Topological Quantum Computing simulator.

TQSim, for Topological Quantum Simulator, simulates a topological quantum computer based on Fibonacci Anyons. It simulates topological quantum circuits with qudits composed of an arbitrary number of anyons.

This package can serve as a tool for research on TQC, as well as for educational and training purposes.
